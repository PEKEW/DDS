Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have received much attention in multiobjective optimization in recent years due to their practicality. However, with limited computational resources, most existing MOEAs can not solve large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs), a class of problems that are widespread in the real world. To improve the ability of MOEAs to deal with LSMOPs, this paper innovatively proposes a dual decomposition strategy (DDS). Firstly, the Outer Decomposition uses a sliding window to divide large-scale decision variables into overlapped subsets of small-scale ones. A small-scale multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) is generated every time the sliding window slides. Then, once a small-scale MOP is generated, the Inner Decomposition immediately creates a set of global direction vectors to transform it into a set of single-objective optimization problems (SOPs). At last, all SOPs are optimized by adopting a block coordinate descent strategy, which guarantees the solutionâ€™s integrity and optimality during optimization. The proposed DDS can be embedded into many existing MOEAs to improve their performance for solving LSMOPs. Compared with four state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, the experimental re- sults also show the remarkable efficiency and solution quality of the proposed DDS in solving LSMOPs. In addition, experimental on two real-world problems show that DDS can achieve the best performance beyond at least one order of magnitude with up to 3072 decision variables.
